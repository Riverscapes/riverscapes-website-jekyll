Consistent documentation is fundamental to the riverscapes philosophy. In practical terms this involves three different types of documentation:

* [Source code documentation](Source_Code) explaining the various components of a tool and how they work
* [Tool web sites](WebSites) for end users to discover, download and run the tools
* [Riverscapes Projects](Riverscapes_Projects) metadata to accompany the outputs of each tool
