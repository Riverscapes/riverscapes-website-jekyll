Together with many talented and creative collaborators, we have built an international [consortium of researchers and software developers](consortium.html) who build tools and pioneer solutions to better understand, simulate & manage our riverscapes . We call ourselves  The Riverscapes Consortium.  The consortium is not defined by any individual or single organization, but is rather a genuine collaboration of scientists whose curiosity and concern about riverscapes and their ecosystems has brought them together. We are a group of scientists that believe a diversity of perspectives and approaches are necessary to tackle the biggest challenges and long-standing questions we face in understanding and better managing riverscapes.

# Tools

Our consortium has been prolific in developing the science and theoretical underpinnings essential to understanding and explaining how riverscapes work and are organized across a range of nested hierarchical spatial scales. We have also committed to building [open-source algorithms, models and GIS tools](https://github.com/Riverscapes) to make it easier for researchers, professionals, practitioners and students to apply those concepts to their own riverscapes.

All of our tools are based on [peer-reviewed](science.html), methods. When we have developed the methods ourselves, we aim to have them vetted, published and disseminate in the peer-reviewed literature. We then also make sure to have a well documented website (you'll find them from RC-Tools menu above and the URL will take the form of sometool.riverscapes.xyz). For most users, the online help documentation and using the tool 'as is' is as far as they need to take it. However, for those so inclined, all of the underlying source-code for these tools, models and algorithms is available in its own GitHub repository at github.com/Riverscapes.
