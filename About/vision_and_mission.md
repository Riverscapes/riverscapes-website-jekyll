## Vision

Our vision is for a world full of vibrant, healthy riverscapes supporting coexisting, thriving ecosystems and human societies. 



## Mission

Our mission is to support locally-led riverscape advocates to build their own communities around **improving and sustaining the health of _their_ riverscapes**. By connecting these diverse local riverscape communities, to similar efforts at regional, national and global scales, we hope to help people tackle these challenges for _their_ riverscapes with the benefit of insights, perspectives, experience and tools from others fighting the same battles in their own riverscapes.
