## More Elaborte Background
This half hour video is based on [Joe Wheaton's](http://joewheaton.org) talk at a Workhop in Lyon, France in December of 2019 on Regionalized Fluvial Geomorphology (see [original slides](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338225952_Riverscapes_Consortium_to_Leverage_Advances_in_Other_Regions_in_your_Regionalization)). It lays out some of the key concepts and part of the motivation for the Riverscapes Consortium and why it we are developing data standards and workflows.

## Talk about Need for Riverscapes Consortium and Standards
The Riverscape Consortium's [Joe Wheaton](http://joewheaton.org) was awarded the [British Society for Geomorphology's](https://twitter.com/BSG_Geomorph) 2020 [Gordon Warwick Award](https://www.geomorphology.org.uk/awards) for excellence in geomorphic research. In his talk below,  he discusses the need for the sort of standards and community embodied in the Riverscape Consortium to rise to the challenge of the scope of riverscape degradation.
