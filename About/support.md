title: Getting Support
---

While all the riverscapes [tools](), [data]() and [science]() are freely available and documented, that doesn't necessarily mean you'll find everything you need to make it work for you or that what we have meets your needs. The consortium is not available for hire per se, but the [individuals behind the consortium]() can be contacted and/or contracted for help with specific problems, projects and inquiries. In general, despite most of these individuals being very busy and in high-demand, we are an altruistic bunch and are largely very generous with our time. That said, very few of these individuals have endless time or resources (i.e. staff) to get work done, and most of us work on soft-money (i.e. grants and contracts). As such, we try to provide as many resources as possible for free to help you 'do it yourself', as well as affordable workshops & courses to get you trained up economically. However, if you need more help, it is availble by contacting the right organizations and individuals listed below.

# Free Online Help for Tools and Data

Each [riverscapes tool]({{ site.baseurl}}/Tools) is documented to varying degrees and you can find basic online help documentation as well as online issue boards (discussion forums) at each tool website.

# Workshops and Courses

Members of the consortium have been involved in delivering a large number of workshops and courses. Many of these trainings feature and/or focus on riverscapes tools. The most formal of these are taught through [Utah State University's Restoration Consortium](https://restoration.usu.edu/), and can be used to count towards a Graduate Restoration Certificate. 

# Analysis

Several consortium members are available to hire as analysts to run tools for your riverscape, do rigorous QA/QC, and help you with interpreting and applying the outputs. While most of the riverscapes tools can be run for free by yourself, if you want the analysis customized and done by the individuals who developed the methods and tools, you can hire various individuals from the RC to help. Some are listed below.

# Tool & Software Development

For changes and improvements to individual models and tools, it is best to contact the individual model owners (typically via the relevant [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/orgs/Riverscapes/dashboard)). [North Arrow Research](http://northarrowresearch.com), the Utah State University [Wheaton ET-AL lab](http://etal.joewheaton.org/), and [South Fork Research](https://www.southforkresearch.org/) have a long history of working together on tool development. Both SFR and USU do a lot of GIS tool and toolbox development. USU develops a lot of new methods and algorithms that only ever make it to the prototype and/or demonstration phase. North Arrow Research are experts at scaling-up these innovations to run at the regional and national scale.
