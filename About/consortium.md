# Like-minded scientists with common, shared vision

Some of us are academics, some work for public agencies, some for non-profits and some for consulting firms. Regardless of the sectors we work in, where our research funding comes from, we are all committed to not reinventing the wheel, and sharing the solutions we develop to better understanding, researching, monitoring, managing, conserving and restoring riverscapes. 





# Some of the ring-leaders



### Origins

The Riverscapes Consortium has existed informally since 2017. The consortium initially grew out of the collapse of funding support for the Columbia Habitat Monitoring Program and Integrated Status and Trend Effectiveness Monitoring Programs. Specifically, there was frustration amongst the Co-Investigators in those programs that even with upwards of US$10 million of year going into monitoring, science, tool development, that the work was to myopically focused within the Columbia River Basin and the tools (and even data streams) were not packaged in away that could help people doing similar efforts within and outside the basin. It was yest another example of the classic reinvention of the wheel (because it is easier in the short-term), instead of the hard work of leveraging past contributions more meaningfully and future proofing work so it can have a lasting impact and be helpful beyond the footprint of just where the bills were being paid. 

Chris Jordan (NOAA Fisheries), Joe Wheaton (Utah State University) and Philip Bailey (North Arrow Research) were the initial ring leaders. Without any funding, they scrambled and tried to motivate the larger teams involved in those programs to try and see over a decade of hard work not just die and be flushed down the Bonneville Power Administration drains of good intentions, but failed efforts and waste. 

Joe started collaborating with other US Agencies (e.g. Bureau of Land Management, U.S.D.A. Natural Resources Conservation Service, U.S.D.A. Forest Service and others) to pursue these efforts with a more deliberate focus on supporting a broader community of researchers, practitioners, managers and others focused on riverscape health.  Also in 2017, Joe started building support for the idea of an International Riverscapes Consortium with academic colleagues and collaborators from the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Italy, New Zealand, and Australia.    



## Governance

### RC Leadership Committee

The RC Leadership Committee sets the agenda and drives the efforts of the RC forward. Since the RC has no formal charter and receives no funding directly, this volunteer-based effort provides 

Tentative Leadership Committee

- Hervé Piegay (Ecolle Normal Superor, CRNS - Le Centre national de la recherche scientifique; France)
- Joe Wheaton (Utah State University; USA)
- Simone Bizzi (Università delgi Studi de Padova; Italy)
- James Brasington (University of Christchurch; New Zealand)
- Kirstie Fryirs (Macquarie University; Australia)
- Alden Shallcross (Bureau of Land Management; USA)

In 2023, they need to meet and adopt and form governance structure and get other committees in place. 



### RC Technical Standards Committee

This  committee helps set standards for technical and technological aspects of the RC. Thus far, this has really been a mix of Matt, Philip and Joe but we’d like to expand this out a bit. Since Philip & Matt

RC Technical Standards Committee might look something likeChairWe should have one member from RC Leadership Committee 2-4 technical expert (software engineer types) initially at least Philip and Fanny 

### RC Scientific Steering Committee

The scientific steering committee should be a little bigger, but the group of scientists who are the chairs of the working groups and take the lead on vetting what gets labeled as RC-Compliant or Pending RC-Compliant, and identifies and promotes RC scientific and management agenda. They also screen RC-Membership applications. 

ChairOne member from RC Leadership Members representing different riverscape science sub-disciplines or thematic areas (e.g. social science riparian ecology, aquatic ecology, geomorphhpology, hydrology, etc.) but with an eye towards diverse representation geographically, ethnically, expertise, career-stage, etc.1-2 riverscape management members

### RC Management & Applications Committee

Form a RC Riverscape Application Management Committee Folks who in charge or management of riverscapes, and research and development from governmental agencies and NGOChair



# The army of scientists and practioners

There are three ways to see who are the primary soldiers getting the work of the Riverscapes Consortium done. One is to look at who is contributing the Code Repositories, and/or Data Warehouses.  The second is to look at the authors of the peer-reviewed publications out of this group. Perhaps most important are those that are contributing the real "work" and sharing information via the Riverscapes Warehouse. This includes anyone who shares a restoration design or as-built, anyone who submits their own analysis, or model run, anyone who takes the time to contribute to a repeat photo-series. 



The bigger army of practitioners, managers, policy makers, decision makers and stakeholders



# The organizations we represent

The individual scientists behind the Riverscapes Consortium are the real innovative force.  However, to varying degrees the institutions we represent, have played a role in facilitating Riverscapes Consortium. 



This should be self-populating based on Riverscapes Consortium accounts and roles.
